// next we need to do VPN connections
// the more VPN connections we fabricated from highly likely intelligence areas with random, or partially encrypted data will clog up those
// decryption services
// VPN is interesting because we can create a lot of half open connections..
// they must consume memory while attempting to pick the sessions  out of the raw wire
// therefore manipulation against platforms becomes possible (to run into memory exhaustion, as well as
// attackig the cryptographic portions)
