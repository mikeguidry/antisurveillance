notes for using pcaps, etc....

someone can start wireshark, and browse a site that they want to add to the attack
if they used macros such as fabricated name, address.. orr other informatin
that could be automatically found, and modified then it would be the simplest
way to append more sessions for attacking

if put into a database.. it could have a list of sites
w management (IE: perform some basic actions using a browser addon
such as clearing things (cookies, etc, ,etc)) and then it can
prepare to spoof somme other useragents...

it would allow people who dont undertand technology to easily inisert 
new sites to fabricate transmissions towards

be sure to save as PCAP not PCAPNG
