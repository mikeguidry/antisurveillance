notes for using pcaps, etc....

someone can start wireshark, and browse a site that they want to add to the attack
if they used macros such as fabricated name, address.. orr other informatin
that could be automatically found, and modified then it would be the simplest
way to append more sessions for attacking

if put into a database.. it could have a list of sites
w management (IE: perform some basic actions using a browser addon
such as clearing things (cookies, etc, ,etc)) and then it can
prepare to spoof somme other useragents...

it would allow people who dont undertand technology to easily inisert 
new sites to fabricate transmissions towards

be sure to save as PCAP not PCAPNG

Would you like to find the NSA's signal intelligence capturing server within your network?  You can use this tool, and monitor traffic
changes as you use it.  It will allow you to sniff out NSA infections on your network.  boom.. shit gets worse everyday.

I mean monitor for increases in traffic obviously directly proportional to this tools injections of traffic.  .. Any decent network admin
should be able to work it out.  If you are worried about real sites obtaining traffic then use specific internal routes in your network
with an array of IPs in the source.  It will allow you to control it further if you are worried about the test in that sort of way.

I have some very interesting tricks that will be released shortly in code which will allow major corporations to use this tool without
worrying about those types of situations.  In the meantime.. I doubt any small business, or individual would create enough traffic to merrit
any real issues on websites whom you are spoofing traffic towards.  The operating systems behind the load balancers to begin with will probably
filter out the majority.  It all depends on where in your network your applyinng this tool, and exactly what kind of intervals.  I wouldn't
personally worry unless your giving the tool 1Tbps.  If that is the case then you should wait for the crafty shit to come.

need a sniffer which can use filters to find particular sessions
should have heuristics to find somme gzip http, dns, etc.. 

so the tool can get executed, and automatically populate & initiate

Code is almost ready to read directly from the wire.  i just need to be sure it wont have much packet loss so it will need another pthread,
or it can happen on the thread designed for flushing to the network

Surveillance platforms probably have limited, or incorrect fragmentation mechanisms.  These attacks are probably two fold resource expensive,
and could hinder operations.
